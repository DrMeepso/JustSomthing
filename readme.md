"there came a man of god, and spake unto the king of israel, and said, thus saith the lord, because the syrians have said, the lord is god of the hills, but he is not god of the valleys, therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that i am the lord, and that i have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel, saying, they are laid desolate, they are given us to consume."

## üîç How It Works

This repo uses a Markov chain to generate Bible quotes. The quotes are generated by using the Bible as a dataset to find the probability of a word appearing after a sequence of words. The quotes are generated by starting with a random word and then selecting the next word based on the probability of it appearing after the current sequence of words. This process is repeated until the desired length of the quote is reached.

This repo will update the latest quote in this README every 10 minutes. ‚è≥

All code for the actual Markov chain is in `index.ts`.

## ‚ùì Why

I was just messing around with Markov Chains and found that the Bible surprisingly yielded good results when prompted. 
It was suggested by a friend, and I am in no way christian.

Feel free to adjust the text further to accurately reflect your intent and experience with the project!
