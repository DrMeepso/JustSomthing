"the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest; and with him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite, one of the three mighty men with david, when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of israel were distressed that day: for saul had adjured the people, saying, cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that i may be avenged on mine enemies."

## 🔍 How It Works

This repo uses a Markov chain to generate Bible quotes. The quotes are generated by using the Bible as a dataset to find the probability of a word appearing after a sequence of words. The quotes are generated by starting with a random word and then selecting the next word based on the probability of it appearing after the current sequence of words. This process is repeated until the desired length of the quote is reached.

This repo will update the latest quote in this README every 10 minutes. ⏳

All code for the actual Markov chain is in `index.ts`.

## ❓ Why

I was just messing around with Markov Chains and found that the Bible surprisingly yielded good results when prompted. 
It was suggested by a friend, and I am in no way christian.
