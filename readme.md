"of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city: and abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him from baale of judah, to bring up from thence the ark of god, whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts, the god of israel, saying; ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, we will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of judah, and in the streets of jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city."

## üîç How It Works

This repo uses a Markov chain to generate Bible quotes. The quotes are generated by using the Bible as a dataset to find the probability of a word appearing after a sequence of words. The quotes are generated by starting with a random word and then selecting the next word based on the probability of it appearing after the current sequence of words. This process is repeated until the desired length of the quote is reached.

This repo will update the latest quote in this README every 10 minutes. ‚è≥

All code for the actual Markov chain is in `index.ts`.

## ‚ùì Why

I was just messing around with Markov Chains and found that the Bible surprisingly yielded good results when prompted. 
It was suggested by a friend, and I am in no way christian.

Feel free to adjust the text further to accurately reflect your intent and experience with the project!
