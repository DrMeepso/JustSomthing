"wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of gedaliah, was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel: and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as i lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out."

## üîç How It Works

This repo uses a Markov chain to generate Bible quotes. The quotes are generated by using the Bible as a dataset to find the probability of a word appearing after a sequence of words. The quotes are generated by starting with a random word and then selecting the next word based on the probability of it appearing after the current sequence of words. This process is repeated until the desired length of the quote is reached.

This repo will update the latest quote in this README every 10 minutes. ‚è≥

All code for the actual Markov chain is in `index.ts`.

## ‚ùì Why

I was just messing around with Markov Chains and found that the Bible surprisingly yielded good results when prompted. 
It was suggested by a friend, and I am in no way christian.

Feel free to adjust the text further to accurately reflect your intent and experience with the project!
